# Axis Insurance Dashboard – Power BI Project

This project presents an interactive dashboard developed using Power BI and Microsoft SQL Server. It focuses on visualizing key insurance data, including claims, policies, customer demographics, and financial performance. The goal is to provide insurance stakeholders with meaningful insights to support better decision-making.

---

## Project Overview

The Axis Insurance Dashboard is designed to help understand trends in policy sales, claims, and customer segments. The dataset includes policy types like Auto, Health, Life, Home, and Travel, with details on claim status, coverage, and premium amounts.

The data used in this project is entirely fictional and was created specifically for demonstration and educational purposes. It was collected, cleaned, and modeled by me as part of the full BI project lifecycle.

## Tools and Technologies

- Microsoft SQL Server – Data cleaning and transformation  
- Power BI Desktop – Dashboard development and visualizations  
- DAX – Custom measures and calculations  
- Excel – Initial formatting and data exploration  

---

## Insights Discovered

- Customers aged 50 and above hold the most policies and have the highest claim volume.
- Travel insurance has the highest total claims and coverage amount.
- A notable percentage of claims are either rejected or pending, especially in Health and Travel segments.
- Approximately 42% of policies are inactive, indicating a potential area for retention improvement.

## Future Improvements

- Add time-based trends for monthly or yearly tracking of premiums and claims
- Introduce segmentation by geography or agent performance
- Integrate customer feedback to track satisfaction and service quality
