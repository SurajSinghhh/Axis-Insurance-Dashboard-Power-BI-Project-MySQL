📂 **Repository**: [Axis-Insurance-Dashboard-Power-BI-Project-MySQL](https://github.com/SurajSinghhh/Axis-Insurance-Dashboard-Power-BI-Project-MySQL)

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard simulates insights for **Axis Insurance**, designed to provide executives and analysts with a clear understanding of policy sales, claim approval patterns, and regional performance.  
The data was processed using **MySQL**, and the dashboard was built in **Power BI Desktop**.

It showcases an end-to-end data analysis pipeline — from data extraction to dashboard publishing — that supports strategic decision-making.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Insurance companies often struggle to visualize and monitor:

- Performance of **agents and sales regions**
- **Claim approval rates** and pending requests
- Distribution of policies by **type and customer demographics**

This dashboard solves that problem by presenting interactive KPIs and visuals for policy types, customer gender, region-wise sales, and approval trends — helping management take data-driven actions.
